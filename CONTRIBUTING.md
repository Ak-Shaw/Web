# Contribution Guidelines



### How can you contribute to Crio Open Source in #IBelieveinDoing Hacktoberfest Edition?



In two ways:

- **As a Creator**
- **As a Learner**



A creator can add a new MicroByte by choosing a topic from here - [MicroByte Topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15SY0OvF-ruqVtvWUogxRg51m6J5VZhbyGECPYIsQdi8/edit?usp=sharing), or can create a topic of their own and choose a respective master repo for the same. Creators must follow the MicroByte Structure as mentioned in the [getting started guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WYVo-O1--RX3hGr6hxPRm6Mz_ky1ErNDUfUZv6oEw_s/edit#heading=h.bc09i7s92ri9). 



A learner can help creators improve the MicroBytes by adding new functionality, fixing bugs, enhancing the learning content or adding better references. 

There are no restrictions on the roles, any participants can make PRs either as a Creator, a Learner or Both. 

Kindly refer the aforementioned [getting started guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WYVo-O1--RX3hGr6hxPRm6Mz_ky1ErNDUfUZv6oEw_s/edit#heading=h.bc09i7s92ri9) for detailed instructions.
