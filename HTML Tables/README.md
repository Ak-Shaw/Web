# How To Create A Registration Form in HTML From Scratch

## Step 1: Choose a HTML editor

### You'll first need a HTML code editor to before you begin this module. There are a lot of options to choose from including:

1. Codepen
2. Notepad ++
3. VSCode
4. Sublime Text
5. NetBeans
6. CoffeeCup

All of these editors have user-friendly interfaces that enable you to manually enter the code. I'll be using Sublime Text3 for this module.

## Step 2: Create a new file with .html extension

The next step is to specify that you intend to create a new HTML file. Do this by creating a new file and then saving it with the .html extension as shown. Itâ€™s easy. Just type the file name (whatever you choose), and then follow it with **.html**. For example-> ``[index.html]``.

## Step 3: Start typing in the HTML code inside the editor

Start your workflow by typing in the basic HTML skeleton code in the .html file. So go ahead and type in the following: 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
